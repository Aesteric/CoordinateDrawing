# CoordinateDrawing
Given a text file containing directions, the program will output a javafx canvas with a drawing

INPUT FORMAT: 
Option 1:
input one of the following things followed by a distance

left, right, up, down

ex.
left 400

There MUST be no spaces at the end of the command and all commands go on seperate lines

Option 2:

You can translate the next location of the line to be drawn using the commands followed by a coordinate

x, y

ex. 
x 300

In addition to this, make sure that if you are using an IDE, the text file is in the same folder as the javaFX application.

Hope this helps, 
Aesteric
